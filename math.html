            <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
            
            A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
            
            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>ax + b = 0</a></h3>  
            
            where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. 
            
            Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
            
            Also, the variable may or may not be an x so dont get too locked into always seeing an x there.
            
            <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
            
            The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
            
            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>ax^2<sup><small>2</small></sup> + bx + c = 0 </a></h3>
            
            where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
            
            <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
            
            [sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
            
            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>A = &#960 &#215 r<sup><small>2</small></sup></a></h3>
            
            or, when you know the diameter (D):
            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd><a id="vyd">A = &#960 / 4) &#215 D<sup><small>2</small></sup></a></h3>
            
            or, when you know the circumference (C):
                            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>A = C<sup><small>2</small></sup> / 4 &#215 &#960</a></h3>
            
            <h2>Intersection</h2>
            
            The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
            
            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }</a></h3> 
            
            That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
