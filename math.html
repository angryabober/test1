            <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
            
            A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
            
                            <h4 id="vyd"style="text-align: center;">ax + b = 0</h4>  
            
            where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. 
            
            Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
            
            Also, the variable may or may not be an x so dont get too locked into always seeing an x there.
            
            <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
            
            The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
            
            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>ax^2 + bx + c = 0 </a></h3>
            
            where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
            
            <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
            
            [sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
            
            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>A = [sign] [sign] r^2</a></h3>
            
            or, when you know the diameter (D):
            <h3 id="vyd"style="text-align: center;">A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D^2  </h3>
            
            or, when you know the circumference (C):
                            <h3 id="algn"style="text-align: center;"><a id=vyd>A = C^2 / 4 [sign] [sign]</a></h3>
            
            <h2>Intersection</h2>
            
            The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
            
                            <a id="vyd"style="text-align: center;">A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }</a>  
            
            That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
